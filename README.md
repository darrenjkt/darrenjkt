# Hey, I'm Darren :wave:

I am a PhD student at the Australian Centre for Field Research (ACFR), University of Sydney. 

:mag_right: Research topics I'm passionate about:

- 3d object detection (temporal and single-frame)
- Multi-target unsupervised domain adaptation
- Camera-lidar sensor fusion 

## Publications :book:

- (ITSC 2021) Optimising the selection of samples for robust lidar camera calibration [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12287)][[code](https://github.com/acfr/cam_lidar_calibration)]
- (RA-L 2022) See Eye to Eye: A Lidar-Agnostic 3D Detection Framework for Unsupervised Multi-Target Domain Adaptation [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09450)][[code](https://github.com/darrenjkt/SEE-MTDA)]
