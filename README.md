# Hey, I'm Darren :wave:

I am a PhD student at the Australian Centre for Field Research (ACFR), University of Sydney. 

:mag_right: Research topics I'm passionate about:

- 3D Perception (i.e. 3d object detection, tracking, segmentation)
- Domain Adaptation (self/unsupervised, semi-supervised)
- 3D Shape completion
- Camera-lidar sensor fusion
