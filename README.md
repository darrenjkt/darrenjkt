# Hey, I'm Darren :wave:

I am a PhD candidate at the Australian Centre for Research (ACFR), University of Sydney. 

I work in the fields of deep learning and computer vision with a focus on 3D Perception and unsupervised domain adaptation. My research aims to allow 3D detectors to generalize across a variety of lidar types and environments without human-annotated labels.
