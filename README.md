# Hey, I'm Darren :wave:

I am a robotics and machine learning engineer with a unique blend of research innovation and industry expertise, bringing high-impact, strategic solutions from concept to successful deployment. I am currently a senior engineer at Greenroom Robotics working on making boats autonomous on Australian waters through marine vessel and mammal detection :ship: :whale: :ocean:
