# Hey, I'm Darren :wave:

I am a computer vision and robotics engineer currently working on making boats autonomous on Australian waters through marine vessel and mammal detection :ship: :whale: :ocean:

My PhD focused on 3D perception in autonomous vehicles with a focus on unsupervised domain adaptation to allow detectors to generalize across a variety of lidar types and environments without needing human-annotated labels for each new domain.
